/* 

Eight Data types in JavaScript 
1. undefined, 
2. null, 
3. boolean, 
4. string, 
5. symbol, 
6. bigint, 
7. number,
8. object.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion.
They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the 
data itself thus any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.

JavaScript create or declare a variable by putting the keyword `var` in front of it
e.g:

    var myName;

creates a variable called myName where in JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.
Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
