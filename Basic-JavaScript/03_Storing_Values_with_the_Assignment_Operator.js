/*

In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).

    myVariable = 5;

This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

    var myVar;
    myVar = 5;

First a variable is craeted called myVar;
Second, a number value 5 is assigned to the variable called myVar.


 */

// Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another

/*

    var myVar;
    myVar = 5;
    var myNum;
    myNum = myVar;

The above declares a myVar variable with no value, then assigns it the value 5. Next,
a variable named myNum is declared with no value. Then, the contents of myVar (which is 5) 
is assigned to the variable myNum. Now, myNum also has the value of 5.

*/

// Test Quiz
// Assign the contents of a to variable b.

// Setup
var a;
a = 7;
var b;

// Only change code below this line

b = a; //solution

console.log(b); // output: 7

// ********************Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator********************

/*
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

    var myVar = 0;

Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0. 

*/

// Test Quiz
// Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.

// solution
var a = 9;
console.log(a);
