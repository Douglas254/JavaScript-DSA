/*
********************Increment a Number with JavaScript********************
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.
Example
    i++;

is the equivalent of

    i = i + 1;

N/B: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.
*/
// Test Quiz
// Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.

let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
// myVar = myVar + 1;

// Solution
myVar++;
console.log(myVar); //Output: 88
